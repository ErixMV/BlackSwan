## About the Project
This is the final project of the AI & Machine Learning Course done by [Fundaci√≥n Esplai](https://fundacionesplai.org). This project is a book recommendation system that collects data of books, users and their ratings. A machine learning algorithm takes all the data and, 
depending on which algorithm is activated, recommendations of a specific book are shown; in this initial version, there are two available algorithms, by correlation matrix and by distances ([KNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm))
### Built With
The front-end is done with [React](https://es.reactjs.org).<br />
The back-end is done with [Python](https://www.python.org) (Flask API)

The retrived data come from:<br />
[Book-Crossing Dataset: User Review Ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/bookcrossing-dataset)<br />

## Usage
Create a virtual enviroment and install the packages from requirements.txt with: <br />
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, in client folder, install all the node packages: <br />
`npm install`

The back-end is an API done with Flask and use the production build of React front-end as the endpoint. So, in the client folder, create it:
`npm run build`

Finally, create the Flask App enviroment variable and start Flask service in the root folder:<br /><br />
Unix Bash:<br />
`export FLASK_APP=app`<br />
`flask run`<br /><br />
Windows CMD<br />
`set FLASK_APP=app`<br />
`flask run`<br /><br />
Windows PowerShell<br />
`$env:FLASK_APP = "app"`<br />
`flask run`<br /><br />

## Roadmap

This is a list of future implementations:

* Dark Mode.
* More data in the recommendations: thumbnails, author, links and genre.
* Layout improvement.
* Algorithm improvement

See the [open issues](https://github.com/ErixMV/BlackSwan/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
